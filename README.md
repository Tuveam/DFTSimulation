# DFTSimulation
Simulating the discrete Fourier Transformation in an intuitive way. No Audio is used, but the program generates a signal in a slow tempo for the user to be able to understand all processes. Explore a couple of digital audio phenomena by reading the questionmark-pages: Addition and Multiplication of Signals, Sampling and Aliasing, the discrete Fourier Transform and the harmonic series.
### Download Builds
Under the [Releases](https://github.com/Tuveam/DFTSimulation/releases) at the right, choose the build ("DFTSimulation_vX.X.[yourOS].zip) for your Operating System and click on it to download. Unpack the zip-File to whereever you want to save it. Inside the folder is a file called "DFTSimulation" or "DFTSimulation.exe". Click on it to execute the program. Optionally, make a link to it and move the link to a more comfortable spot. But do not move any of the already existing files out of the folder, else the program won't work.
### Customize
In the folder of the program is a png-Image called "ColorPalette.png". The first three pixels of each row of the image are used to color the GUI. You can customize the image to make your own colored GUI, but keep its size! Have fun customizing!
