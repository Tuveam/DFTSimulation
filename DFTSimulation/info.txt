DFT-Simulation
v1.0
Made by Victor Keilhack

This Program aims at simulating a Discrete Fourier Transform
of a signal of your choice. The samplerate is much lower in
order to make the calculations much more accessible/visible.
Try around turning knobs and pressing buttons in the software
and discover the DFT aswell as the harmonic series, aliasing,
constructive and destructive interference, signal multiplica-
tion and more. If you want a more guided approach, press the 
question mark in the upper left corner.

Also check out the video playlist on YouTube about this 
program. If you want to modify or look at the code, this 
project is available on GitHub.
